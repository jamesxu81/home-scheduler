## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended for Next.js)

1. **Create a Vercel account** at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. **Connect your GitHub repository**
   - Click "New Project" in Vercel dashboard
   - Search for and import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings
3. **Add Environment Variables**
   - In Vercel project settings, add `DATABASE_URL`
   - Use a PostgreSQL database (e.g., Vercel Postgres, AWS RDS, Neon)
   - Example: `postgresql://user:password@host:5432/home_scheduler`
4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy" - Vercel handles tests, build, and deployment
   - Your app is now live!

### Deploy to GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions

**Note**: This requires a PostgreSQL database (GitHub Pages is static only)

The included GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
1. Runs all unit tests
2. Builds the Next.js production bundle
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages (if tests pass)
4. Prevents deployment if tests fail

To enable:
1. Push code to main branch
2. Go to repository Settings → Pages
3. Select `GitHub Actions` as the deployment source
4. Workflow will run automatically on each push

### Database Setup for Deployment

Create a PostgreSQL database with one of these services:
- **Vercel Postgres** - Integrated with Vercel
- **Neon** - Serverless PostgreSQL (free tier available)
- **AWS RDS** - Managed PostgreSQL service
- **Render** - PostgreSQL hosting with free tier

Once created, set `DATABASE_URL` in your deployment platform's environment variables.

## Data Storage & Database

This application uses PostgreSQL for persistent data storage:

### Database Models
- **FamilyMember** - Stores user profiles with names, ages, colors, and photos
- **Event** - Stores event details with title, date, time, category, description, and recurring settings

### Recurring Events
- **Categories**: Daily, Weekly, Weekdays (Mon-Fri), or Monthly
- **Duration**: Optional end date for recurring schedules
- **Expansion**: Events automatically expand based on recurrence rules
- **Storage**: `repeatType` and `repeatUntil` fields store recurrence configuration

### Prisma ORM
- Type-safe database queries with TypeScript
- Automatic migrations for schema changes
- Connection pooling via Prisma Client

### Environment Setup
Set up database connection in `.env.local`:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/home_scheduler"
```

### Database Initialization
```bash
# Create/migrate database schema
npx prisma migrate dev

# View database in Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio
```

## Weather Integration

The app includes integrated weather forecasts for event planning:

### Features
- **Weather Display**: Shows temperature and condition for upcoming event dates
- **Multiple Views**: Weather visible in list view, calendar month view, and weekly view
- **Default Location**: Auckland, New Zealand (customizable via `setUserLocation()`)
- **API Provider**: Open-Meteo free weather API (no authentication required)
- **Forecast Range**: Automatically limited to 15 days ahead for performance optimization
- **Smart Caching**: 
  - 1-hour cache per individual date to avoid duplicate API calls
  - Persistent month-level caching so weather survives page navigation
  - Throttling prevents excessive API calls when navigating months

### Technical Details
- **Backend Route**: `/api/weather` proxies requests through Next.js server
- **Parameters**: `temperature_2m_max`, `temperature_2m_min`, `weather_code`, `humidity`, `wind_speed`
- **Optimization**: Only first 15 days of each month are fetched from API
- **Weather Icons**: WMO-based emoji mapping (☀️ Sunny, ⛅ Cloudy, 🌧️ Rainy, etc.)
- **Location**: Latitude/Longitude based (default: -37.7749, 174.8860 for Auckland)

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Testing

This project includes comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage of critical functionality:

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (auto-rerun on file changes)
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Important: Tests Required Before Building
The build process includes a **prebuild hook** that automatically runs all tests. The build will fail if any test fails. This ensures code quality and prevents broken deployments.

```bash
# This automatically runs tests first
npm run build
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes automated testing and deployment via GitHub Actions:

### Continuous Integration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Runs on every push to main/develop and pull requests
- Tests on Node.js 18 & 20 for compatibility
- Runs ESLint for code quality checks
- Builds the production bundle
- Generates test coverage reports
- Uploads test artifacts for review

### Deployment Workflow (`.github/workflows/github-pages-deploy.yml`)
- **Test Gate**: All unit tests must pass before deployment
- **Build Gate**: Production build must succeed
- Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages on successful tests and build
- Prevents deploying broken code to production

## Tips for Family Use

1. **Share on a shared family device** - Keep a tablet in a common area
2. **Use categories effectively** - Helps you quickly scan what type of event it is
3. **Add descriptions** - Include pickup times, locations, or special notes
4. **Use family member colors** - Makes it easy to see at a glance whose event it is
5. **Regular sync** - Have a weekly family meeting to plan ahead

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Make your changes and run tests: `npm test`
3. The build process also runs tests: `npm run build`
4. If tests pass, commit and push: `git push origin feature/my-feature`
5. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
6. CI/CD pipeline automatically tests your changes
7. Merge when tests pass and code review is complete

### Database Migrations
When modifying the database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`:
```bash
